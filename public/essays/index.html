        <h1>My Final Project Homework</h1>

        <h2>Q1. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS.</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>HTML:</b> Content: describes the structure of a web page, and tells the browser how to display the content. It is a markup language that uses tags to define elements within a document. Most elements require a beginning and end tag, with the content placed between the tags. It is human-readable, meaning markup files contain standard words, rather than typical programming syntax.</li>
            <li><b>CSS:</b> Appearence: defines styles for web pages, including the design, layout, and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</li>
            <li><b>JavaScript:</b> Behavior: It is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. In JavaScript, it is possible to change the type of a variable or add new properties or methods to an object while the program is running.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page Web Sites?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>A single-page application helps keep the user in one web page that you visit and doesn’t require page reloading during use, and works within a browser. Its content is presented to the user in a simple, easy, and “natural” environment in the browser, which means no page reloads, no extra wait time. Example: Gmail, Google Maps, Facebook, GitHub.</li>
            <li>A Multiple-page application works in a “traditional” way that loads new pages when you click a link. MPAs provide a visual map of where to go with few level menu navigations. MPAs are large, bigger than SPAs as SPA can cache any local storage effectively.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What is the difference between Web Designer, Front End Developer and Back End Developer?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>A Web Designer</b> could be someone who designs the look and feel of a site and will never touch the code. Specifically, UX designers study and research how people use the sites while UI designers are generally focused on visual design, but they might know light HTML, CSS, and JS so they can communicate their ideas more effectively to the front end developer.</li>
            <li><b>A Front End Developer</b> transfers the designs to what the user can see and interact with. It includes everything the user experiences directly: from text and colors to buttons, images, and navigation menus. It’s important to note that, although frontend developers deal with the visual and interactive side of a website, they don’t actually design these front-facing elements. Main front end language: HTML, CSS, JS.</li>
            <li><b>A Back End Developer</b> works on the server side and build the industry. The backend usually consists of three parts: a server, an application, and a database. Users can’t see the backend work, but this code is what communicates the database information to the browser, which enables the user-facing side to exist.</li>
        </ol>
