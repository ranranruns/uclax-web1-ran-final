        <h1>My Final Project Homework</h1>

        <h2>Q1. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>HTML:</b> Content: describes the structure of a web page, and tells the browser how to display the content. It is a markup language that uses tags to define elements within a document. Most elements require a beginning and end tag, with the content placed between the tags. It is human-readable, meaning markup files contain standard words, rather than typical programming syntax.</li>
            <li><b>CSS:</b> Appearence: defines styles for web pages, including the design, layout, and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</li>
            <li><b>JavaScript:</b> Behavior: It is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. In JavaScript, it is possible to change the type of a variable or add new properties or methods to an object while the program is running.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page Web Sites?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A single-page application helps keep the user in one web page that you visit and doesn’t require page reloading during use, and works within a browser. Its content is presented to the user in a simple, easy, and “natural” environment in the browser, which means no page reloads, no extra wait time. Example: Gmail, Google Maps, Facebook, GitHub.</li>
            <li>A Multiple-page application works in a “traditional” way that loads new pages when you click a link. MPAs provide a visual map of where to go with few level menu navigations. MPAs are large, bigger than SPAs as SPA can cache any local storage effectively.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is the difference between Web Designer, Front End Developer and Back End Developer?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>A Web Designer</b> could be someone who designs the look and feel of a site and will never touch the code. Specifically, UX designers study and research how people use the sites while UI designers are generally focused on visual design, but they might know light HTML, CSS, and JS so they can communicate their ideas more effectively to the front end developer.</li>
            <li><b>A Front End Developer</b> transfers the designs to what the user can see and interact with. It includes everything the user experiences directly: from text and colors to buttons, images, and navigation menus. It’s important to note that, although frontend developers deal with the visual and interactive side of a website, they don’t actually design these front-facing elements. Main front end language: HTML, CSS, JS.</li>
            <li><b>A Back End Developer</b> works on the server side and builds Web Services, APIS, Storage Secure Info. The backend usually consists of three parts: a server, an application, and a database. Users can’t see the backend work, but this code is what communicates the database information to the browser, which enables the user-facing side to exist.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Distinguish the difference between Site Relative, Document Relative, and Absolute Paths</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Site Relative: Start with forward slash '/path/to/file.jpg', they're more flexible. Document Relative: Relative to the file you are working on; start with ./ They're particularly useful when the current site/document and the linked site/document are in the same folder and are likely to remain together; Absolute Paths: An absolute path always contains the root element and the complete directory list required to locate the file.</li>
            <li>Absolute paths always provide the complete website address where you want the user to go, whereas relative links only point to a file or a file path. When a user clicks a relative link, the browser takes them to that location on the current site. For that reason, you can only use relative links when linking to pages or files within your site, and you must use absolute links if you're linking to a location on another website.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Project Description</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Who is the client?</b> Still Life Ceramics. It’s a ceramics studio located in DTLA, making functional ceramic art for everyday life.</li>
            <li><b>What is its purpose?</b> Promote online & outdoor classes and the artwork of local LA artists.</li>
            <li><b>Why did you choose this subject?</b> A shared passion for ceramics. As we start heading into the new year, we're doing a lot of eager and excited planning to move into 2021 with fresh optimism. Same with the Still Life Ceramics. They try to keep all the uncertainty and anxiety light, and come up with online & outdoor classes for people who love working with clay. However, not enough customers aware of these class options and understand how the online classes work. As the online (zoom) space is becoming increasingly crowded, Still Life Ceramics may need to continue this business model beyond the pandemic. Therefore, it's important to build its online presence while acquire, retain customers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What does it mean for a company to be Agile. What is the purpose of using Agile, and its Pros and Cons.</h2>
            <p>In essence, an agile approach involves breaking one task into discrete modules, which they test individually before continuing. An agile team also practice the following values to the entire organization:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Individuals and interactions over process and tools</li>
            <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
            <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
            <li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Pros:</b> Rapid delivery; Adaptable; Collaborative (better communication); Quick problem detection; Continuous improvement.</li>
            <li><b>Cons:</b> Hard to predict; Ephemeral planning; Paperwork gets left behind; Over focused on the client-side; Lack of overall cohesion; Challenges at scale.</li>
        </ul>
