        <h1>My Final Project Homework</h1>

        <h2>Q1. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>HTML:</b> Content: describes the structure of a web page, and tells the browser how to display the content. It is a markup language that uses tags to define elements within a document. Most elements require a beginning and end tag, with the content placed between the tags. It is human-readable, meaning markup files contain standard words, rather than typical programming syntax.</li>
            <li><b>CSS:</b> Appearence: defines styles for web pages, including the design, layout, and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</li>
            <li><b>JavaScript:</b> Behavior: It is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. In JavaScript, it is possible to change the type of a variable or add new properties or methods to an object while the program is running.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page Web Sites?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A single-page application helps keep the user in one web page that you visit and doesn’t require page reloading during use, and works within a browser. Its content is presented to the user in a simple, easy, and “natural” environment in the browser, which means no page reloads, no extra wait time. Example: Gmail, Google Maps, Facebook, GitHub.</li>
            <li>A Multiple-page application works in a “traditional” way that loads new pages when you click a link. MPAs provide a visual map of where to go with few level menu navigations. MPAs are large, bigger than SPAs as SPA can cache any local storage effectively.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is the difference between Web Designer, Front End Developer and Back End Developer?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>A Web Designer</b> could be someone who designs the look and feel of a site and will never touch the code. Specifically, UX designers study and research how people use the sites while UI designers are generally focused on visual design, but they might know light HTML, CSS, and JS so they can communicate their ideas more effectively to the front end developer.</li>
            <li><b>A Front End Developer</b> transfers the designs to what the user can see and interact with. It includes everything the user experiences directly: from text and colors to buttons, images, and navigation menus. It’s important to note that, although frontend developers deal with the visual and interactive side of a website, they don’t actually design these front-facing elements. Main front end language: HTML, CSS, JS.</li>
            <li><b>A Back End Developer</b> works on the server side and builds Web Services, APIS, Storage Secure Info. The backend usually consists of three parts: a server, an application, and a database. Users can’t see the backend work, but this code is what communicates the database information to the browser, which enables the user-facing side to exist.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Distinguish the difference between Site Relative, Document Relative, and Absolute Paths</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Site Relative: Start with forward slash '/path/to/file.jpg', they're more flexible. Document Relative: Relative to the file you are working on; start with ./ They're particularly useful when the current site/document and the linked site/document are in the same folder and are likely to remain together; Absolute Paths: An absolute path always contains the root element and the complete directory list required to locate the file.</li>
            <li>Absolute paths always provide the complete website address where you want the user to go, whereas relative links only point to a file or a file path. When a user clicks a relative link, the browser takes them to that location on the current site. For that reason, you can only use relative links when linking to pages or files within your site, and you must use absolute links if you're linking to a location on another website.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Project Description</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Who is the client?</b> Still Life Ceramics. It’s a ceramics studio located in DTLA, making functional ceramic art for everyday life.</li>
            <li><b>What is its purpose?</b> Promote online & outdoor classes and the artwork of local LA artists.</li>
            <li><b>Why did you choose this subject?</b> A shared passion for ceramics. As we start heading into the new year, we're doing a lot of eager and excited planning to move into 2021 with fresh optimism. Same with the Still Life Ceramics. They try to keep all the uncertainty and anxiety light, and come up with online & outdoor classes for people who love working with clay. However, not enough customers aware of these class options and understand how the online classes work. As the online (zoom) space is becoming increasingly crowded, Still Life Ceramics may need to continue this business model beyond the pandemic. Therefore, it's important to build its online presence while acquire, retain customers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What does it mean for a company to be Agile. What is the purpose of using Agile, and its Pros and Cons.</h2>
            <p>In essence, an agile approach involves breaking one task into discrete modules, which they test individually before continuing. An agile team also practice the following values to the entire organization:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Individuals and interactions over process and tools</li>
            <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
            <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
            <li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Pros:</b> Rapid delivery; Adaptable; Collaborative (better communication); Quick problem detection; Continuous improvement.</li>
            <li><b>Cons:</b> Hard to predict; Ephemeral planning; Paperwork gets left behind; Over focused on the client-side; Lack of overall cohesion; Challenges at scale.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Define the following roles: Project Manager, Business Analyst, Scrum Master, UX designer, Web Developer/Engineer, Quality Assurance Tester, and DevOps.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Project Manager:</b> responsible for the day-to-day management of the project and must be competent in managing the six aspects of a project, i.e., scope, schedule, finance, risk, quality, and resources. Project managers work on specific projects with definite outcomes, have time limits, and have to stay within a budget.</li>
            <li><b>Business Analyst:</b> responsible for bridging the gap between IT and the business using data analytics to assess processes, determine requirements and deliver data-driven recommendations and reports to executives and stakeholders.</li>
            <li><b>Scrum Master:</b> The glue of a teams agile process. They're responsible for supporting a project, providing guidance to the team and product owner, and ensuring all agile practices are followed by team members.</li>
            <li><b>UX designer:</b> A UX designer’s role is directly involved in the process of making a product useful, usable, and enjoyable for its end users. As UX design is a constant iteration process, UX designer always learns and prepares for future updates.</li>
            <li><b>Web Developer/Engineer:</b> who takes a web design which has been created by either a client or a design team - and turns it into a website with programming languages. They are also responsible for the site's maintenance, and any other technical aspects.</li>
            <li><b>Quality Assurance Tester:</b> Gatekeeper to any issues that we misse. They run various tests on software to ensure it meets all standards and guidelines and is ready to be marketed to consumers. They identify issues and run debugging programs as needed. They also generate reports, work with software developers to correct issues, and upgrade databases as required.</li>
            <li><b>DevOps:</b> manage the operations of software development, implementing engineering tools and knowledge of the software development process to streamline software updates and creation. DevOps engineers (and DevOps teams) sit in between development and deployment, making sure that everything is geared towards releasing updates as efficiently as possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is the difference between jpg, gif, png and svg images?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group):</b>JPGs can support millions of colors, so this file type is ideal for real-life images, like photographs. The JPG is "lossy," which means that the reduction of file size results in the reduction of image quality. JPGs do not support transparency.</li>
            <li><b>GIF (Graphics Interchange Format):</b> GIFs have the unique ability to display a sequence of images, which is a series of separate GIF images that are linked together to create motion or animation. GIFs are "lossless" - meaning that a GIF retains all the data in the file, but they are smaller than JPGs, specifically because they only accommodate up to 256 indexed colors. GIFs also support transparency.</li>
            <li><b>PNG (Portable Network Graphics):</b>PNGs were designed for use on the Internet and is the most largely used image compression format on the web. PNGs are better suited for images involving text, charts, screenshots, and detailed color illustrations. Like GIFs, PNG file formats also support transparency, but PNGs support variable transparency, where users can control the degree to which an image is transparent.</li>
            <li><b>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):</b>SVGs are vector graphics that allows you to create very high-quality graphics and animations that do not lose detail as their size increases. SVG's can be animated, support transparency, and any combinations of colors or gradients. SVG is a lossless file format like GIF and PNG, and they tend to be fairly light files compared with other formats for the web.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What are testing environments? What is the difference between Local, Dev, QA and Production?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Testing Environment:</b>A test environment is a server that allows you to run the test cases you have defined. It enables you to create identical environments every time you need to test your product.</li>
            <li><b>Local:</b> Developers create and debug their initial code on their local machines. The local environment is under the full control of the individual developer because they can experiment without affecting the work of other developers.</li>
            <li><b>Dev:</b>The shared location for all developers to check their code against all the changes in that release. It’s known as integration testing and a common practice to automate these tests such that after code is updated to the repository.</li>
            <li><b>QA:</b>It’s more about after Dev testing. QA testing requires a known state of code and a stable set of test data in order to communicate issues effectively to the developers. Since the dev environment changes with every build, it invalidates the testing already performed since the bugs logged may now be fixed or new bugs introduced.</li>
            <li><b>UAT</b>User Acceptance testing </li>
            <li><b>Production:</b>To make sure the infrastructure is as identical to Production as possible. Load or stress testing is performed where the application is pushed to its limits. Run additional testing like security and user acceptance testing that hasn’t been tested in the QA environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Function vs Form: When are web images considered part of the content (HTML) as opposed to part of the appearance (CSS)?</h2>
            <p>There are two ways to add images to a web page.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>With the <b>img</b> HTML element.</li>
                <li>With the <b>background-image</b> CSS property.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Use img when the image is part of the content of the web page and use background-image when the image is a part of the page presentation or visual design.</p>


        <h2>What is considered the right size for an image or video asset?</h2>
        
        <p>How do we make the file as small as possible without losing too much quality?</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Recommend using image files of less than 500 KB for best results</li>
            <li>Smaller than 1500 pixels may appear blurry or pixelated when they stretch to fill containers</li>
            <li>Keeping file size small for loading</li>
            <li>Static images = Min size of destination of image</li>
            <li>2500 or 2560 Pixels for full width images, smaller views increment down by 500 pixels</li>
            <li>1800 to 2000, thumbs = 1500 in lightboxs</li>
            <li>Scaling above 100% will pixelate the image (bitmap/raster)</li>
            <li>Mobile/Device will resize the image down</li>
            <li>Use low rez image. Copyright concers.</li>
        </ul>
