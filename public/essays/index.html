        <h2>Q1. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS.</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><b>HTML:</b> Content: describes the structure of a web page, and tells the browser how to display the content. It is a markup language that uses tags to define elements within a document. Most elements require a beginning and end tag, with the content placed between the tags. It is human-readable, meaning markup files contain standard words, rather than typical programming syntax.
            </li>
            <li><b>CSS:</b> Appearence: defines styles for web pages, including the design, layout, and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</li>
            <li><b>JavaScript:</b> Behavior: It is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. In JavaScript, it is possible to change the type of a variable or add new properties or methods to an object while the program is running.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page Web Sites?</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>A single-page application helps keep the user in one web page that you visit and doesn’t require page reloading during use, and works within a browser. Its content is presented to the user in a simple, easy, and “natural” environment in the browser, which means no page reloads, no extra wait time. Example: Gmail, Google Maps, Facebook, GitHub.</li>
            <li>Multiple-page applications work in a “traditional” way that loads new pages when you click a link. MPAs provide a visual map of where to go with few level menu navigations. MPAs are large, bigger than SPAs as SPA can cache any local storage effectively.</li>
        </ol>
