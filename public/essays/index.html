        <h2>Q1. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS.</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><b>HTML:</b> Content: describes the structure of a web page, and tells the browser how to display the content. It is a markup language that uses tags to define elements within a document. Most elements require a beginning and end tag, with the content placed between the tags. It is human-readable, meaning markup files contain standard words, rather than typical programming syntax.
            </li>
            <li><b>CSS:</b> Appearence: defines styles for web pages, including the design, layout, and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</li>
            <li><b>JavaScript:</b> Behavior: It is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. In JavaScript, it is possible to change the type of a variable or add new properties or methods to an object while the program is running.</li>
        </ol>
